## Interactive Visibility Plotter of Astronomical Objects 

`interactive_plotting_SourceVisibility.py` is a python script to plot interactively the visibility of an astronomical source from a certain geographic location (observatory) as afunction of UTC time. 
It has a few external requirements that need to be installed in advance: 
[streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/). 


 A screenshot can be seen [in this figure](https://github.com/tremou/source_visibility-plotter/blob/main/visibility_plotter.png).  

## Getting started

 `streamlit run interactive_plotting_SourceVisibility.py` 
 
 is the command to start the script that will be running on a localhost and can be tuned through a web browser.
